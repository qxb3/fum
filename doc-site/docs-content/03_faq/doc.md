## Why is there a delay in updating/changing the music?

> Two things: your internet & cpu. Everytime the song/music has been updated fum will fetch/download the image so depending on your internet speed this might take a while. after the image has been fetched fum will also decode the image to properly render the image from your terminal and this decoding is done thru your cpu.

## Why is there a slight or huge cpu spike whenever music is updated/changed?

> As stated in the answer above fum will also require to decode the image to properly render the image, And this decoding part is expensive.
